# dating_sentiment_analysis

As a heterosexual, college-aged woman, my dating pool, unfortunately, consists of college-aged men. Using sentiment analysis and text extraction, I wanted to determing the Subjectivity and Polarity of my ex's text messages from either immediately before or immemidiately after we decided to end things. As you go through this code, My hope is that you don't find my dating history realatable, but I do hope you find it entertaining.

Polarity is an attribute of sentiment analysis in which the output  lies between -1 and 1, where -1 refers to a negative sentiment and +1 refers to positive sentiment.

Subjectivity is the output that lies within 0 and 1, and refers to personal opinions and judgments.
