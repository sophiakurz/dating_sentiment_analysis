# dating_sentiment_analysis

As a heterosexual, college-aged woman, my dating pool, unfortunately, consists of college-aged men. Using sentiment analysis and text extraction, I wanted to determine the Subjectivity and Polarity of my ex's text messages from immediately before or immediately after we decided to end things. As you go through this code, I hope that you don't find my dating history relatable, but I do hope you find it entertaining.

Polarity is an attribute of sentiment analysis in which the output  lies between -1 and 1, where -1 refers to negative sentiment and +1 refers to positive sentiment.

Subjectivity is the output between 0 and 1 and refers to personal opinions and judgments.
