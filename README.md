My dating pool, unfortunately, consists of 22-year-old men. I wanted to determine the Subjectivity and Polarity of my ex’s text messages from immediately before or immediately after they, or I, decided to end things. As you go through this code, I hope that you don’t find my dating history relatable, but, rather, entertaining.

Polarity is an attribute of sentiment analysis in which the output lies between -1 and 1, where -1 refers to negative sentiment and +1 refers to positive sentiment.

Subjectivity is the output between 0 and 1 and refers to personal opinions and judgments.

All identities have been anonymized; each individual is identified only by a letter (C, A, J, or G).
